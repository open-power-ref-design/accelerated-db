CHECK FILES:
  Each file ending in _check will be executed whenever deploy.sh is run.  This way we are able to ensure a config.yml file has all of the necessary pre-reqs fulfilled.  This comes in handy when a recipe repository has multiple configurations for a given deploy.

  Check file requirements
  - Expected to be executable, 
  - The given input will be a config file in yaml format.
  - Each check is expected to look and see if it's needed.  If not, exit immediately
